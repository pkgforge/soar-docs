# Soar 0.11

## 0.11.0

Soar 0.11 focuses on simplification and improved user experience, removing deprecated features and adding quality-of-life improvements.

### Breaking Changes

**Nest functionality removed**: The `nest` feature has been removed. If you were using nests to manage custom repositories, migrate to the standard repository configuration in `config.toml`. See [Configuration](../configuration.md) for details on adding custom repositories.

**`--external` flag removed**: The `--external` flag for `soar defconfig` has been removed. Previously this flag enabled non-core repositories in the generated config. Now, no external repositories are provided by default, so you'd need to add them manually in your config.

### Custom Desktop File Path

You can now configure where desktop files are installed. By default, Soar places `.desktop` files in `~/.local/share/applications` (user mode) or `/usr/local/share/applications` (system mode). If you need them elsewhere, set the `desktop_path` field in your config:

```toml
desktop_path = "/path/to/custom/applications"
```

Alternatively, use the `SOAR_DESKTOP` environment variable.

### Release Notes on Update

When updating Soar itself, you'll now see release notes for the new version. This helps you stay informed about new features, breaking changes, and bug fixes without having to check the documentation manually.

The update experience has also been improved with clearer progress indicators and status messages.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed detection of default repositories when no config file exists
